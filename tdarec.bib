  abstract = {Time-series data are amongst the most widely-used in biomedical sciences, including domains such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Structure within time series data can be captured by the tools of topological data analysis (TDA). Persistent homology is the mostly commonly used data-analytic tool in TDA, and can effectively summarize complex high-dimensional data into an interpretable 2-dimensional representation called a persistence diagram. Existing methods for statistical inference for persistent homology of data depend on an independence assumption being satisfied. While persistent homology can be computed for each time index in a time-series, time-series data often fail to satisfy the independence assumption. This paper develops a statistical test that obviates the independence assumption by implementing a multi-level block sampled Monte Carlo test with sets of persistence diagrams. Its efficacy for detecting task-dependent topological organization is then demonstrated on simulated fMRI data. This new statistical test is therefore suitable for analyzing persistent homology of fMRI data, and of non-independent data in general.},

We investigate the statistical properties of landscapes, such as weak convergence of the average landscapes and convergence of the bootstrap. In addition, we introduce an alternate functional summary of persistent homology, which we call the silhouette, and derive an analogous statistical theory.},

The proposed method computes the exact probability in quadratic time while the permutation tests require exponential time. As illustrations, we apply the method to simulated networks and a twin fMRI study. In case of the latter, we determine the statistical significance of the heritability index of the large-scale reward network where every voxel is a network node.},

  abstract = {In recent years permutation testing methods have increased both in number of applications and in solving complex multivariate problems. A large number of testing problems may also be usefully and effectively solved by traditional parametric or rank-based nonparametric methods, although in relatively mild conditions their permutation counterparts are generally asymptotically as good as the best ones. Permutation tests are essentially of an exact nonparametric nature in a conditional context, where conditioning is on the pooled observed data as a set of sufficient statistics in the null hypothesis. Instead, the reference null distribution of most parametric tests is only known asymptotically. Thus, for most sample sizes of practical interest, the possible lack of efficiency of permutation solutions may be compensated by the lack of approximation of parametric counterparts. There are many complex multivariate problems (quite common in biostatistics, clinical trials, engineering, the environment, epidemiology, experimental data, industrial statistics, pharmacology, psychology, social sciences, etc.) which are difficult to solve outside the conditional framework and outside the nonparametric combination (NPC) method for dependent permutation tests. In this paper we review this method along with a number of applications in different experimental and observational situations (e.g. multi-sided alternatives, zero-inflated data and testing for a stochastic ordering) and we present properties specific to this methodology, such as: for a given number of subjects, when the number of variables diverges and the noncentrality of the combined test diverges accordingly, then the power of combination-based permutation tests converges to one.},

  abstract = {A suitable feature representation that can both preserve the data intrinsic information and reduce data complexity and dimensionality is key to the performance of machine learning models. Deeply rooted in algebraic topology, persistent homology (PH) provides a delicate balance between data simplification and intrinsic structure characterization, and has been applied to various areas successfully. However, the combination of PH and machine learning has been hindered greatly by three challenges, namely topological representation of data, PH-based distance measurements or metrics, and PH-based feature representation. With the development of topological data analysis, progresses have been made on all these three problems, but widely scattered in different literatures. In this paper, we provide a systematical review of PH and PH-based supervised and unsupervised models from a computational perspective. Our emphasizes are the recent development of mathematical models and tools, including PH software and PH-based functions, feature representations, kernels, and similarity models. Essentially, this paper can work as a roadmap for the practical application of PH-based machine learning tools. Further, we compare between two types of simplicial complexes (alpha and Vietrois-Rips complexes), two types of feature extractions (barcode statistics and binned features), and three types of machine learning models (support vector machines, tree-based models, and neural networks), and investigate their impacts on the protein secondary structure classification.},

However, tools that provide statistical inference for observations that are persistence diagrams are limited. Specifically, there is a need for tests that can assess the strength of evidence against a claim that two samples arise from the same population or process. This expository paper provides an introduction to randomization-style null hypothesis significance tests (NHST) and shows how they can be used with sets of persistence diagrams. The hypothesis test is based on a loss function that comprises pairwise distances between the elements of each sample and all the elements in the other sample. We use this method to analyze a range of simulated and experimental data. Through these examples we experimentally explore the power of the p-values. Our results show that the randomization-style NHST based on pairwise distances can distinguish between samples from different processes, which suggests that its use for hypothesis tests upon persistence diagrams is reasonable. We demonstrate its application on a real dataset of fMRI data of patients with ADHD.},

We propose to model topologically complex datasets using vector bundles, in such a way that the base space accounts for the large scale topology, while the fibers account for the local geometry. This allows one to reduce the dimensionality of the fibers, while preserving the large scale topology. We formalize this point of view, and, as an application, we describe an algorithm which takes as input a dataset together with an initial representation of it in Euclidean space, assumed to recover part of its large scale topology, and outputs a new representation that integrates local representations, obtained through local linear dimensionality reduction, along the initial global representation. We demonstrate this algorithm on examples coming from dynamical systems and chemistry. In these examples, our algorithm is able to learn topologically faithful embeddings of the data in lower target dimension than various well known metric-based dimensionality reduction algorithms.},

The computational efficiency of our procedure is based on the observation that one can empirically simulate a null distribution that is universal across many hypothesis testing applications involving persistence homology. Our observation suggests that one can simulate the null distribution efficiently based on a small number of summaries of the collected data and use this null in the same way that p-value tables were used in classical statistics. To illustrate the efficiency and utility of the null distribution we provide procedures for rejecting acyclicity with both control of the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) and the False Discovery Rate (FDR). We will argue that the empirical null we propose is very general conditional on a few summaries of the data based on simulations and limit theorems for persistent homology for point processes.},
