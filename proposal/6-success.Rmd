# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

* greater solidity and stability of TDA ecosystem in R
* greater efficiency of TDA research & analysis by R users

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

* monthly download rates greater than current rate for, e.g., {TDA}
* blog posts by users detailing their use of these packages
* published research that cites these packages
* contributions to code base from users; ideally, handoff of some packages to new maintainers

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

* analogous improvements to the more "hands-on" side of TDA including computational topology (random simplicial complexes, mapper(-like) constructions)

## Key risks
<!-- 
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

 - [ ] People
 - [ ] Processes
 - [ ] Tooling & Technology
 - [ ] Costs
