# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

Our aspirations for this project are a more stable TDA ecosystem in R that supports greater efficiency of TDA research and analysis by R users.

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

Our benchmarks for project completion are twofold: (1) publication of packages on CRAN, and (2) complete workflows, published in vignettes, blog posts, or software journal articles, that use these tools to perform typical analysis and modeling tasks in practical settings, including using real-world data.

After completion, we will follow several indicators to judge success and prompt necessary follow-up work, including monthly download rates,
<!--(which we would like to see meet or exceed those of the current most popular TDA packages like {TDA})-->
questions and problems raised on Stack Exchange (in addition to issues raised on the package repositories), blog posts by users, citations in published research, and user contributions to code base.
That last would be a very strong indicator of success.

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

Much will remain after these aims to make this modular R package ecosystem for topological data analysis more comprehensive.
Immediate next goals include (1) a new lightweight package of basic tools for handling persistence data, such as an efficient data structure and common distance measures; (2) a revived {Mapper} package for exploratory TDA [@Singh2007], from which additional multi-purpose low-level packages may be spun off; and (3) tools for working with Reeb graphs, such as the `ReebGraphPairing` Java package [^rgp] to compute extended homology.

## Key risks
<!-- 
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

We foresee two primary risks to this proposal:
Before publication, the greatest risk is that structures and procedures used in Matlab and C++ may not translate easily to R. Alternative solutions are to implement directly from theory (persistent images) and to include separate implementations for different tasks (Ripser).
After publication, the greatest risk is lack of community uptake.
It may be that there is and will be less appetite than we expect for more customizable tools outside the specialist community.
To reduce this risk, we focus this proposal on the most common yet least aavailable tools, based on conversations with colleagues.
