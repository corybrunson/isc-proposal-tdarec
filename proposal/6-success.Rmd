# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->

Our aspirations for this project are a more stable TDA ecosystem in R that supports greater efficiency of TDA research and analysis by R users.

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->

Our benchmarks for project completion are twofold: (1) publication of packages on CRAN, and (2) complete workflows, possibly published in vignettes, blog posts, or software journal articles, that use these tools to perform typical analysis and modeling tasks in practical settings, including using real-world data.

Going forward from completion, we will follow several indicators to judge success and prompt necessary follow-up work:

* monthly download rates, which we would like to see meet or exceed those of the current most popular TDA packages like {TDA}
* questions and problems raised on Stack Exchange (in addition to issues raised on the package repositories)
* blog posts by users detailing their use of these packages
* published research that cites these packages
* contributions to code base from users

On the last point, a very strong indicator of success would be user contributions to the code base. Ideally, we would be able to hand maintenance of some packages in the collection to other members of the user community.

## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->

Much will remain after these aims to provide a comprehensive R package ecosystem for topological data analysis.
Advances are acutely needed in at least two areas: (1) exploratory TDA, including mapper [@Singh2007] and similar constructions like FibeRed [@Scoccola2023] that can be manipulated interactively and extended in new directions by users; and (2) computational and statistical topology, including tools to study the asymptotics of random simplicial complexes.

## Key risks
<!-- 
What sort of things could come up that can delay or break the project?

 - [ ] People
 - [ ] Processes
 - [ ] Tooling & Technology
 - [ ] Costs

* software incompatibilities (e.g. Ripser & {Rcpp})
* poor performance (Brunson, for one, has no background in high-performance programming)
* lack of uptake by community despite promotion (would falsify our inferences about need?)
