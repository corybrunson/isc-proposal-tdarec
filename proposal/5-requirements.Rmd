# Requirements
<!-- 
An idea of what is required to make the project actually happen
-->

## People
<!--
Who needs to be involved, what's the proposed structure, what will it take to get their involvement?
-->

The PIs (Drs. Brunson and Stamm) will lead development on the three aims.
**Aymeric, who are / will be your collaborators, and how will development work?**
Dr. Brunson has previously and does currently recruit undergraduate research assistants to contribute to software projects in ways that are accessible without advanced experience with R, for example to draft new functions of an established type and to write longform documentation. If interested students are found, this grant will support their contributions.

Both PIs work near colleagues who use TDA in their work or who develop TDA theory or software, and several have agreed to review new tools and provide practical feedback, especially as it pertains to their probability of adopting these tools into their own work or recommending them to their colleagues.
The Laboratory for Systems Medicine, which employs Dr. Brunson, is piloting an internal peer review for lab-developed software to be stored on a shared account, and all products from this project will be submitted there.

## Processes
<!-- 
What processes need to be put in place e.g. codes of conduct, regular ISC meetings, handover to the community at large?
-->

* Package infrastructure (licenses, contributing, codes of conduct)
* Publication on CRAN
* Promotion by Tidymodels or through Tidymodels channels

## Tools & Tech
<!--
What is going to be needed to deliver this project? 

Will cloud computing be used - if yes are there are necessary components that will be deciding factors between providers?

Are there tools or tech that don't exist that will be produced to facilitate the project?
-->

* R, Tidyverse, Tidymodels, {Rcpp}
* collaboration through GitHub
* no original theory but some original implementations

## Funding
<!-- 
[TO DO] THE GUIDANCE IS PRETTY UNCLEAR, ESP IN LIGHT OF GABOR'S PROPOSAL VS AWARD SIZE
-->

The timeline above envisions both PIs contributing between 1/4 and 1/3 PTE during a 4-month award period, with some effort and funding delegated to collaborators and student mentees.
At a mean salary of about $80,000/year, this amounts to roughly $18,000 total.
A smaller amount will support Aims 1 and 2 to the extent possible, with Aim 3 contingent on success with Aim 2.
