**Primary goal:** {recipes} extension for vectorizations (and other pre-processing transformations) of persistence data.

The following transformations should be implemented or imported [@Fasy2020; @Pun2022; @Ali2022]:

Statistical vectorizations

* Persistence statistics [@Ali2022]
* Entropy summary [@Ali2022]
* 2D histogram [@Fasy2020]

Algebraic vectorizations

* Algebraic functions [@Ali2022]
* Tropical coordinate functions [@Ali2022]
* Complex polynomial [@Ali2022]

Curve vectorizations

* Betti curve [@Fasy2020; @Ali2022]
* Lifespan curve [@Ali2022]
* Persistence landscape [@Fasy2020; @Ali2022]
* Persistence silhouette [@Ali2022]

Functional vectorizations

* Persistence surface [@Pun2022]
* Persistence image [@Fasy2020]
* Template functions [@Ali2022]

**Secondary goal:** Redesign {TDAstats} to specialize in hypothesis tests and better integrate into tidy workflows.

1. Remove Ripser and {ggplot2} code in favor of dependency on {ripserr} and {ggtda}.
2. Identify additional hypothesis tests and null models that should be included [@Robinson2017; @VejdemoJohansson2022].
3. Use standard classes and methods (e.g. class 'htest', method `print()`) to make output follow common R conventions; include {generics} methods like `tidy()`.

**Note:**
[{arulesteps}](https://github.com/corybrunson/arulesteps) provides proof-of-concept for a {recipes} extension.
