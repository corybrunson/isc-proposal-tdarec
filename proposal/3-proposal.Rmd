# The proposal
<!--
This is where the proposal should be outlined. 
-->

Our **goal** is to seamlessly integrate popular techniques from topological data analysis (TDA) into common statistical workflows in R.
The **expected benefit** is that these extensions will be more widely used by non-specialist researchers and analysts, which will create sufficient awareness and interest in the community to extend the individual packages and the collection.

## Overview
<!--
At a high-level address what your proposal is and how it will address the problem identified. Highlight any benefits to the R Community that follow from solving the problem. This should be your most compelling section.
-->

Tidymodels [@Kuhn2020] provides a complete toolkit for common machine learning (ML) tasks.
ML relies heavily on vectorizations, and the last decade of work in TDA has produced several for topological data.
Our **first aim** is to make these available in a Tidymodels-compatible R package.

[^tidymodels]: <https://www.tidymodels.org/>

TDA relies heavily on statistical inference.
A variety of hypothesis tests have been proposed in the research literature and have idiosyncratic implementations.
Our **second aim** is to provide a Tidymodels-compatble package for permutation-based hypothesis testing with topological data.

The primary workhorse for TDA is Ripser, which efficiently computes Vietoris--Rips filtrations.
<!--The standalone wrapper {ripserr} is method- and dependency-light and additionally interfaces to the cubical Ripser of @Kaji2020, making it ideal for projects that don't rely on comprehensive TDA toolkits.-->
The engine used in the lightweight wrapper package {ripserr} is missing key features, so our **third aim** is to upgrade it.

## Detail

**Aim 1:**
Publish a {recipes} extension for ML vectorizations based on persistent homology.

<!--Several pre-processing extensions have been published for Tidymodels, including {embed}, {themis}, and {textrecipes}.[^recipes-extensions]-->
The new package would provide `step_*()` functions for several topological transformations and document the process for contributing additional steps.
From among many proposed transformations [@Fasy2020; @Pun2022; @Ali2022], we intend to include the following in a first release based on their relative simplicity, time on CRAN, frequency of use, and expected implementation cost: persistence statistics, Betti curve, lifespan curve (to be implemented anew), persistence landscape (to rely on the forthcoming {plt}), and persistent image (to be adapted from the original Matlab implementation [^persistence-images]).

**Aim 2:**
Publish a {flipr} extension for permutation-based statistical inference on topological data.

Dr. Stamm leads a coordinated package collection for permutation-based inference, with the published {flipr} package at its center. This package features (i) implementations of classic permutation schemes that are agnostic to the type of input and (ii) the central `PlausibilityFunction` R6 class for seamless hypothesis testing and confidence estimation.
Several extensions are published or in development for specific data types, including {nevada} for network-valued data, {fdatest} for functional data, and unpublished extensions for scalar- and vector-valued data.
<!--Extensions can then be contributed to enablepermutation-based hypothesis testing and confidence regions for specific data types. An extension for network-valued data, {nevada}, is also published. Two unpublished extensions provide support for scalar- and vector-valued data. The {fdatest} package dedicated to inference for functional data is also undergoing a complete redesign to work with {flipr}.-->
The new package will extend methods for two-sample testing, ANOVA, hypothesis testing, and confidence estimation to data types arising from TDA.
It will inherit non-parametric combination (NPC) [@Pesarin2010], which enables the use of several test statistics in a single hypothesis test, making the combination sensitive to different aspects of the compared underlying distributions.

<!--
Base R provides the standard ‘htest’ output class for hypothesis tests, for which the Tidymodels {broom} package provides a suite of tidiers. These tools make programmatic statistical inference straightforward. A key advantage of the new package will be to extend this facility to statistical inference in TDA.
-->

[^nevada]: <https://cran.r-project.org/package=nevada>

<!--
Redesign {TDAstats} to specialize in hypothesis tests and better integrate into tidy workflows.

1. Remove Ripser source code and {ggplot2} plotting routines in favor of dependency on {ripserr} and {ggtda}.
2. Identify additional hypothesis tests and null models that should be included [@Robinson2017; @VejdemoJohansson2022].
3. Use standard classes and methods (e.g. class 'htest', method `print()`) to make output follow common R conventions; include {generics} methods like `tidy()`.

The following hypothesis tests are already implemented:

* permutation test for difference in means [@Robinson2017]

The following hypothesis tests may be implemented (listed in order of likely inclusion and feasibility):

* bootstrap sample hypothesis tests [@Blumberg2014]
* Z-test and permutation test for persistence landscapes [@Bubenik2015], currently implemented in {plt}
* exact topological inference [@Chung2017]
* tests for grouped point clouds [@Abdallah2023]
-->

**Aim 3:**
Refactor {ripserr} with a current implementation of Ripser and connect additional options to R.

The base implementation of Ripser is written in C++, and {ripserr} provides integration via {Rcpp}.
We therefore anticipate that this update will be a straightforward, though not trivial, exercise in C++/R integration.
In particular, it will provide options to retrieve representative cycles and cocycles for topological features, which are essential for many practical applications.

<!--
A novel feature that may pose an additional challenge is the recovery of representative cocycles and/or cycles. These features did not exist when {ripserr} was first developed but are essential for many practical applications.
While an ideal interface would pass options to a single C++ function, a simpler approach is available in case this proves impractical, namely to interface to one of multiple C++ functions depending on user specifications.
