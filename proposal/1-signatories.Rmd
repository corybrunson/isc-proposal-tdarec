# Signatories
<!-- 
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on popularity but community acceptance is important.  Willingness to accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery. 

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R are proposed.

## Project team
<!-- 
Who are the people responsible for actually delivering the project if the proposal gets accepted and are already signed up and rearing to go?
-->

**Describe each member of the team (including advisors) and the skills they bring to the project.**

**Jason Cory Brunson, PhD**
(Project Co-lead):
Dr. Brunson is a mathematician by training with a long-running interest in topological data analysis. He has authored or contributed to several TDA packages on CRAN, including {TDAstats}, {ripserr}, {simplextree}, {tdaunif}, **{ggtda}, and {plt}**, the last **three** of which he maintains.

**Aymeric Stamm, PhD**
(Project Co-lead):
Dr. Stamm ...

**Paul Rosen, PhD**
(Advisory Board Member):
Dr. Rosen ...

**Bertrand Michel, PhD**
(Advisory Board Member):
Dr. Michel ...

**February: Ask Peter, Hubert, and/or Henry about being an Advisory Board member.**

## Contributors

Several other "TDAverse" packages are published on CRAN, installable from GitHub, or in development.
Major contributors include Raoul Wadhwa (Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University), Matt Piekenbrock (Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University), Yara Skaf (College of Medicine, University of Florida), and James Otto (Department of Statistical Science, Baylor University).

## Consulted
<!-- 
Who has been given the opportunity to provide feedback on the proposal? This should include any R Consortium & ISC members who the proposal has been discussed with.
-->

**February: Request input and feedback from Brittany Fasy.**

We have also solicited feedback on drafts of this proposal from members of the following research groups:

* the Topological Data Analysis Discussion Group at the University of Florida[^tda-discussion]
* the Laboratory for Systems Medicine at the University of Florida[^lsm]
* presenters at UFTDA2024[^uftda2024], a conference organized by the Bubenik lab and hosted at the University of Florida

[^tda-discussion]: <https://people.clas.ufl.edu/nikola/topological-data-analysis-discussion-group/>
[lsm]: <https://systemsmedicine.pulmonary.medicine.ufl.edu/>
[^uftda2024]: <https://people.clas.ufl.edu/peterbubenik/uftda2024/>

Feedback has been consistent on the following points:

Regarding TDA software in general

1. Most techniques used in TDA are not easily accessible or well documented and require significant training or experimentation to use.
2. Most practitioners implement at least some tools described in published studies from scratch.

Regarding solutions to the problems motivating this proposal

3. No software resource provides a convenient and comprehensive set of vectorization methods for persistence data.
4. Most hypothesis-testing work is conducted using original _ad hoc_ code.
5. Practitioners frequently use (various implementations or ports of) Ripser in longer computational pipelines that would otherwise be impractical.

This feedback suggests that practitioners face challenges when using TDA software that, though they are overcome by specialists, are likely to be daunting to non-specialist researchers and analysts.
