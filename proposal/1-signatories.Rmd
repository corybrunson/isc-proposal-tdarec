# Signatories
<!-- 
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on popularity but community acceptance is important.  Willingness to accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery. 

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R are proposed.

## Project team
<!-- 
Who are the people responsible for actually delivering the project if the proposal gets accepted and are already signed up and rearing to go?

Describe each member of the team (including advisors) and the skills they bring to the project.
-->

**Jason Cory Brunson, PhD**
(Project Co-lead):
Dr. Brunson (Assistant Professor, University of Florida) is a mathematician by training with a long-running interest in topological data analysis. He has authored or contributed to several TDA packages on CRAN, including {TDAstats}, {ripserr}, {simplextree}, {tdaunif}, the last of which he maintains.

**Aymeric Stamm, PhD**
(Project Co-lead):
Dr. Stamm ...

**Paul Rosen, PhD**
(Advisory Board Member):
Dr. Rosen (Associate Professor, University of Utah) is a computer scientist who focuses on geometric and topological approaches in scientific and information visualization and has authored several computational tools for TDA.

**Bertrand Michel, PhD**
(Advisory Board Member):
Dr. Michel (Professeur, l'Ecole Centrale Nantes) researches statistical learning and is interested in statistical methods for geometric and topological inference. He coauthored {flipr} with Dr. Stamm and others.
