# Project plan

## Start-up phase
<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is important because projects need to get up and running quickly.


 - [ ] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [ ] Licence decisions
 - [ ] Reporting framework
-->

Platform: GitHub tdaverse account & existing package repos (+ {tdarec})

Licenses: consistent with existing packages and Tidyverse (GPL >= 2)

Reporting framework: monthly progress reports per timeline below

## Technical delivery
<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should provide at least a high-level the implementation. 

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery
-->

1. {recipes} extension for topological data transformations (<= 4mo)
    1. R external engines or original implementations of transformations (<= 2mo)
    2. template {recipes} extension (<= 2wk)
    3. complete implementation of a single transformation & documentation of all necessary steps (including unit tests, documentation, and examples) (<= 2wk)
    4. checklisted implementations of remaining transformations (<= 4wk)
    5. vignette illustrating complete modeling workflow using topological transformations (<= 1wk)
2. {TDAstats} redesign (<= 2mo)
    1. replace internal Ripser code with {ripserr} dependency (<= 1wk)
    2. rewrite {ggplot2} plots in base R (<= 1wk)
    3. structure hypothesis test results as `"htest"` objects (<= 1wk)
    4. revise hypothesis testing vignette (<= 1wk)
    5. implement additional hypothesis tests (<= 1mo)

## Other aspects
<!--
Covering non-technical activities like on-going publicity, paper preparation, discussion groups etc. that might be required to facilitate successful delivery of the project.

 - [ ] Announcement post
 - [ ] Delivery blog post
 - [ ] Twitter
 - [ ] UseR!
 - [ ] ISC meetings
-->

* social media
* R-bloggers cross-posts: package tutorials, CRAN releases
* conference submissions (useR!, rstudio::conf, ASA)
* in-person workshop at UF TDA 2025? (**March: Ask Peter.**)
