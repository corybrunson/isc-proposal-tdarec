# Project plan

## Start-up phase
<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is important because projects need to get up and running quickly.

 - [ ] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [ ] Licence decisions
 - [ ] Reporting framework
-->

<!--Platform: GitHub TDAverse account & existing package repos-->

Development will take place publicly on two GitHub accounts: TDAverse, co-owned by Dr. Brunson (Aims 1 and 3), and LMJL-Alea, co-owned by Dr. Stamm (Aim 2).
Both PIs will have write access to the repositories for all project packages.

<!--Licenses: consistent with existing packages and Tidyverse (GPL >= 2)-->

All project packages will be licensed compatibly with R and Tidyverse (MIT or GPL >= 2).

[^r-licenses]: <https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/>

The PIs will provide the R Consortium with monthly progress reports based on the expected dates of the deliverables below.

## Technical delivery
<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should provide at least a high-level the implementation. 

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery
-->

1. {recipes} extension for topological data transformations (<= 16wk)
    1. R external engines or original implementations of transformations (<= 6wk)
    2. template {recipes} extension (<= 2wk)
    3. complete implementation of a single transformation & documentation of all necessary steps (including unit tests, documentation, and examples) (<= 2wk)
    4. checklisted implementations of remaining transformations (<= 4wk)
    5. vignette illustrating complete modeling workflow using topological transformations (<= 2wk)
2. {flipr} extension for topological data types ()
    1. ...
3. {ripserr} upgrade (<= 8wk)
    1. selection and reconciliation of current Ripser implementations in C++ (<= 3wk)
    2. {Rcpp} integration into package (<= 3wk)
    3. updated vignette illustrating new functionality (<= 2wk)

## Other aspects
<!--
Covering non-technical activities like on-going publicity, paper preparation, discussion groups etc. that might be required to facilitate successful delivery of the project.
