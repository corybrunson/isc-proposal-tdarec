# The Problem
<!-- 
Outlining the issue / weak point / problem to be solved by this proposal. This should be a compelling section that sets the reader up for the next section - the proposed solution!

It is important to cover:

 - [ ] What the problem is
 - [ ] Whom it affects
 - [ ] Have there been previous attempts to resolve the problem
 - [ ] Why it should be tackled

* R is one of the top languages for statistics: implementations of new methods, use by professional statisticians, use by nonspecialist analysts
* TDA is an emerging and highly heterogeneous area of statistical research
* R packages for TDA tend to be (a) designed for specialist researchers rather than general users, (b) self-contained rather than modular, (c) inconsistent or incompatible with the conventions and structures of common workflows, and (d) reliant on libraries written in other languages
* this has likely hindered and prevented the adoption of TDA approaches by researchers and analysts in myriad domains (e.g. <https://rseek.org/> search for "topological data analysis" returns a handful of commentaries, tutorials, and workshop notes, most of which use only one package and all of which are several years old[^search])

* previous attempts ({TDA}, {rgudhi}) basically port other libraries into R; they are successful in providing tools, but they require users to rely on opaque source code and figure out how to incorporate the tools into their own work, and they are made fragile by the delicate demands of adapting to upgrades in source code language and in R (note: both {TDA} and {rgudhi} have been removed from CRAN due to emergent issues not being corrected in time)
* there is limited funding for maintaining TDA software, arguably in part because maintainers do not receive much professional recognition, itself in part because no critical mass of users frequently cites the products

* the TDAverse is an unfunded program to build a general-purpose, modular, native, interoperable, and extensible R package collection for TDA: currently proof-of-concept, downloaded between 25% and 50% as frequently as {TDA}; not yet as interoperable and extensible as envisioned
* several users have requested features or expressed interest in contributing
* resolving these issues may increase uptake and involvement
